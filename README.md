PICU - A Persistent and Intrinsic Currency Unit

Some picu is worth more than others.

Try e3pi.org or depending on how many bugs the size of alligators this week, try emailing angry Collins if he's around to try and get a key for the gate. Good luck with that.

Like Larry "From Bremerton", we accept that both patience, and `all the good gawdamned time in the whole wide world' i.e., `laziness' -are virtues.

Seeking truly despicable ex-used car salesmen, street criminals of sharp practices, petty thieves and druggies after all the low-hanging fruit, to apply for membership to our rotten to the core Picu Foundation, a misanthrope pack of lying cheating thieves if there ever was one.
