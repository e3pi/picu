PICU - A Persistent and Intrinsic Currency Unit

Some picu is worth more than others.


PROBLEM: pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

A digest collision:

Two different picu:

p1 = 1.000233168645477295  

p2 = 1.000233168645477419

...differ in the last three digits, with p1 of the atom e = 2.7182818... and p2
of no known proven transcendentals.

p1 of expression stringlength 9, and p2 of length 46.

The problem is, with this counterexample, how far out along their decimal expansion need we go and take a string  of sufficent size to semi-reliably 
affix uniqueness and so submit a minimalist digest  as a zero knowledge/claim proof?

CANDIDATE THOUGHTS FOR WORK AROUND SOLUTIONS sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

p1 is of PH1 and p2 is of PH3, we should not be tracking both apples and oranges in the same database, so we need the five hoods kept independent for now, or all picu respective digest require the extra baggage of what hood they reside in.

Or, we need to pack around much larger digests to prevent collisions with future potential claims.


REFINE 
======

psi_{ph_nn} - greek letter := upper bound of all integer approximations among pihood ph_{ph_nn}
Of a modest 0.75 million listed picu - almost all worthless - provides a sample to empirically determine psi's
so the rarer hipsi - high-Psi - may be reliably assigned.

A semi-stable Picu Valuation Formula

As big orchard miners produce a vast Pacific Ocean of relatively infinite picu candidates to our droplets, this will reduce value over time for everyone in the beginning, then stop -- being bounded by psi's fixed wall. Nature's psi is our friend.


MINING
======

emacs 
-----

macros regexes to find good candidate differences, eg, ff++ -ff, and ratios  ff++/ff

pari/GP
_______

perl driver file to write pari foo.gp programs


perl (C, python, java, js for clent)
----
infty/arbitrary precision Math::Bignum to get beyond needing pari/GP's library

rnd(monte carlo) and permutes over atoms ops and eventually parens


perl/python adapt bioinformatics as CATGXYZ biosyn proteins,




Simp
----

Such as maxima's, reducing machine mined picu candidates stringLength(ff) for higher valuation.


The Verifier
------------
Eliminate human determination  of trivial candidates and false positives, would allow for a partial knowledge p2p picu candidate verification

perl's recursive descent parens parser, balanced parens, and RPN.


ML
--
move to front minimal string distances, intrisic simian, baysian, markov, gp and all else of ML popular routines
fitting for off the beaten path mining excursions.


MINING RIGS
-----------

ASIC crushed, eBay el cheapo BTC GPU rigs adapted into trivally easy parallel runs.

Parallela? What's this? Can we use it?




//////////////////////////// DO NOT READ BELOW - ..PENDING OPINION AND FOMENTING TODAY's PARTISAN RAGE

Try e3pi.org or depending on how many bugs the size of alligators this week, try emailing angry `The Screamer' Collins if he's around to try and get a key for the gate. Good luck with that.


As Larry "From Bremerton", like we're suppose to  accept his  phony baloney `bhuddist' patience, and `all the good gawdamned time in the whole wide world' i.e., `laziness' -are virtues. Some of us are men who work for a living, and we're of the opinion your complacent cheerful disposition are sufficient grounds for termination. 
Stop taking money out of my wallet and stealing my air Fucker!

THE PICU FOUNDATION   - Just Say NO!

Thet're seeking truly despicable sleazy ex-used-car salesmen, street criminals of sharp practices, serial bankruptees, greedy `entitled' lawyers who think they're able to contribute any gawdmaned thing to tech, petty thieves and druggies after all the low-hanging fruit --to apply for membership to our rotten to the core Picu Foundation --our misanthrope pack of lying evil poseurs with shit eating grins, a pack of thieving cheating selfish worst than worthless toothless whores if ever there was one. VOTE NO! HELL NO! We must resoundingly denounce and shame these despicable assholes!
