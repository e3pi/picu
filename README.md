PICU - A Persistent and Intrinsic Currency Unit

Some picu is worth more than others.

Try e3pi.org or depending on how many bugs the size of alligators this week, try emailing angry `The Screamer' Collins if he's around to try and get a key for the gate. Good luck with that.

Like Larry "From Bremerton", we accept that both patience, and `all the good gawdamned time in the whole wide world' i.e., `laziness' -are virtues.

Seeking truly despicable sleazy ex-used-car salesmen, street criminals of sharp practices, lawyers who know perl CGI and js, petty thieves and druggies after all the low-hanging frui, to apply for membership to our rotten to the core Picu Foundation, a misanthrope pack of lying cheating thieves if ever there was one.
